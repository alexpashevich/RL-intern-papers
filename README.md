# RL-intern-papers

This file consists of four sections where (1) grasping-realted, (2) RL in robotics, (3) continuous high-dimensional action space RL and (4) general deep RL papers correspondingly are provided. Each section consists of summaries of several papers on the topic. This file aims to describe state-of-the-art methods that can be potentially useful during the internship.
